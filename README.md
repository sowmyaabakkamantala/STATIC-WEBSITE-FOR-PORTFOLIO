##I HAVE DONE THE PROJECT-1 TO BUILD A STATIC WEBSITE FOR PORTFOLIO.I HAVE DONE THIS BY TAKING REFRENCES FROM CHATGPT AND YOUTUBE.I HAVE DONE MY VERY FIRST TASK VERY EASILY.A STATIC PORTFOLIO WEBSITE IS BUILT USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT, DELIVERING THE SAME CONTENT TO EVERY VISITOR WITHOUT SERVER-SIDE PROCESSING OR DATABASE INTERACTIONS. THIS TYPE OF WEBSITE IS IDEAL FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO DISPLAY THEIR WORK, SKILLS, AND CONTACT INFORMATION IN A CONSISTENT AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE MANNER.
